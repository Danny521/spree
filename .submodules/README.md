Build `Spear` with:
```
$ sbt assembly
```
A shaded JAR can then be found at `target/scala-2.10/spear-with-dependencies-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

This submodule currently lives here as a somewhat hacky way to make sure Meteor ignores it, cf. [this Meteor forum post](https://forums.meteor.com/t/best-way-to-have-meteor-ignore-files/4406).
